### SQL Injection
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a web attack whereby an adversary is able to execute malicious SQL statements that control a web application's database server.

In the right circumstances, an attacker can use SQL injection to bypass a web application's authentication and authorisation mechanisms and retrieve sensitive contents of an entire database. SQL injection can be used to add, modify, and delete database records, affecting data integrity.

### Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a common attack vector that involves injecting malicious code into a input field on a vulnerable website. Unsanitised input fields that do not check for malicious code will execute the code, which could potentially give adversaries root access to the web server hosting the vulnerable website.

### Remote File Inclusion
Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is another common attack vector in whereby an adversary can gain access to remote files by exploiting a web application that dynamically includes external files or scripts.
