### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Hypertext Transfer Protocol, better known as HTTP, is the protocol that web clients and web servers use to communicate. It is the "language" that clients and servers speak to one another in order to exchange information.

HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, which determines how web clients (i.e. web browsers) and servers respond to various commands.

HTTP is known as a **request-response** protocol. This means that a  client makes an HTTP request to a web server asking for a web resource (i.e. an HTML page), and the server will return the resource in its HTTP response message.

### Domain Name System (DNS)
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system for translating website names into numbers (IP addresses). Every website and internet-connected device has an associated IP address. PentesterLab's IP address, for example, is <a href="54.172.242.130">54.172.242.130</a>.

Evidently, long numbers like these is hard to remember, and DNS provides a solution to this. Instead, a user is able to access PentesterLab by visiting <a href="http://pentesterlab.com">pentesterlab.com</a> &mdash; DNS provides the functionality that syncs human-readable website addresses with their associated IP addresses.
